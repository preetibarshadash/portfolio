          These days, I'm diving into DevOps and cloud technologies like{" "}
          <strong>Docker</strong>,<strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>AWS</strong>, while also dabbling a bit in frontend
          development with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> as you can see,
          I've built this website. I'm refining my microservices architecture,
          experimenting with GraphQL, Kafka , MongoDB and CI/CD pipelines, and
          generally learning, building, and sprinkling a bit of fun into
          everything I do ðŸŽ¨. If you have an exciting project or opportunity,{" "}
          <strong>feel free to contact me</strong> , I'm always up for
          challenges, collaboration, and creating something awesome!
